        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our 
          approach to your gastronomic satisfaction is to offer a unique experience 
          that blends classic Thai cuisine with modern techniques and skills. 
          Although Thai cuisine is widely known for its hotness, our unmatched 
          innovation will take you to another level where a variety of tasteful 
          flavors can be savored. At The Regent, we place great emphasis on food 
          quality and strive to maintain continual excellence. We begin the preparation 
          of every dish with a careful selection of high-end ingredients. Even 
          for common ingredients found in Thai cuisine, we ensure that they are 
          best-in-class and able to deliver on high taste expectations. Our selectiveness 
          is also reflected in such components as higher-quality, bigger-sized 
          seafood and more tender beef. Furthermore, these ingredients are seasoned 
          to perfection with various exotic natural herbs and spices. <font color="#999999">We are proud to achieve great taste in all dishes without resorting 
          to MSG or any other artificial flavor enhancements.</font> Not only 
          are our dishes simultaneously fresh and not bland, they offer a variety 
          of health benefits amidst the currently health-conscious trend. They 
          will delight and satisfy your appetite, while being neither heavy nor 
          fattening.</font></p>

          discover that our dishes are artfully displayed, as all food components 
          are arranged to precision to catch your eyes. Coupled with the fusion 
          of classic and modern designs under soft candle lights, we offer a warm, 
          relaxing, and romantic atmosphere to balance your otherwise busy lifestyle. 
          As our display sculptures show that Thai natives are proud of their 
          art and high craftsmanship, our food reflects these fabulously crafted 
          items, and we hope to share with you our pride and serve as your ambassador 
          to Thai delicacies and progressive application of the ancient Thai history.</font></font></font></p>

          AND THAI AGAIN: The chunky teak chairs on the patio at 1910 18th St. 
          NW hint at what the new business might be selling, and a whiff of the 
          air inside -- fragrant with curry and sweet herbs -- confirms my hunch: 
          Another Thai restaurant has landed in Washington. This one is called 
          The Regent (202-232-1781) and this one, in a space vacated by 88 in 
          Circle, is uncommonly serene, thanks to a collection of rich wood carvings 
          and walls painted a soothing shade of sage. Owner Chuchart &quot;Bobby&quot; Kampirapang worked as a waiter and cook at the late Chef's Secret in 
          College Park prior to opening this 100-seat restaurant late last month; 
          he hired Saowaluk Wiyagul, a veteran of the kitchens at Busara in Washington 
          and Thai Taste in Manassas to create the menu for the Regent. If the 
          prices are a little higher than what you typically find at the competition, 
          the cooking is several notches more polished. The proof is in the panang 
          (try chicken), sweet with coconut milk and bright with kaffir lime leaves, 
          as well as whole grilled trout stuffed with lime slices and lemongrass. 
          Billed as a house specialty, that fish comes with a dipping sauce of 
          julienne mango and red chilies that brings a sweat on the brow -- and 
          keep you coming back for more. </font></font></font></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE 
          LOUD SIZZLE preceding the arrival of my beef entree, neua krata, seems 
          out of place in the context of the serene Regent Thai Cuisine, where 
          the only other sounds on a slow weeknight have been gentle background 
          music and the tinkle-tinkle of a nearby fountain. The dish sputters 
          like beef fajitas but smells sweetly of Asian spices. A jumble of thin 
          slices of marinated beef, snow peas and other vegetables strewn with 
          sesame seeds, it is one of several signature dishes that set this Thai 
          newcomer apart from the crowd. It's tasty, if a bit more expensive than 
          what you tend to find at your typical issuer of papaya salad and drunken 
          noodles. The Regent takes the place of 88 -- and too many other restaurants 
          that have tried to make a go of it on a tricky part of 18th Street NW 
          that seems to belong neither to Adams Morgan nor to Dupont Circle. Launched 
          in July by Chuchart Kampirapang, it gets a boost from Saowaluk Wiyagul 
          in the kitchen and an eye for detail in the dining room. This is apparent 
          early on, with an appetizer of tom yum goong. The shrimp and mushroom 
          soup comes framed in a handsome square-sided bowl, and its assertive 
          flavors -- cilantro, lemon grass, red chilies -- slap my tongue around 
          in a bid for attention. Similarly fetching are spring rolls filled with 
          carrots, cabbage and taro root, cut on the bias and presented as fragile 
          spears with pineapple dipping sauce. There are two high-ceilinged rooms, 
          and both give you a sense of being far away from Washington. A small 
          forest of handsome wood carvings and moss green walls wrap visitors 
          in style and comfort, and the blocky teak chairs and tables underscore 
          the Thai theme. The restaurant bears a resemblance to the nearby Rice 
          in Logan Circle, from the soothing color palette right down to the &quot;Green 
          Corner&quot; emphasizing vegetarian dishes on its bill of fare. Of the 
          signature dishes, the standout is grilled whole trout. The fish is moist, 
          meaty and -- thanks to slices of lemon and lime as well as lemon grass 
          tucked inside -- also fragrant and flavorful. Presented on banana leaf, 
          it's enhanced by a sharp dipping sauce fueled by garlic, lime juice 
          and chilies. Pork-and-seafood dumplings are too compact, and duck is 
          limp and cloying with its honey sauce and dry watercress. Now and then, 
          the kitchen also oversweetens things. But the winners outnumber the 
          lesser choices. Ordering basil fried rice, for instance, brings a glistening 
          mound of fragrant grains stir-fried with the namesake herb, strips of 
          red pepper, a blazing chili sauce and a choice of meat or seafood. Drunken 
          noodles here are thick, slippery and pleasantly smoky ribbons, punched 
          up with a similar sauce and best ordered with tender scored squid. And 
          everything brims with style: Instead of on a plastic check tray, your 
          bill is delivered in a sleek wooden box.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the outskirts of Dupon Circle, a Thai new comers in mixing style and tradition with sometimes decent results. But there is room for improvement.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">HOW MANY THAI restaurants does it take to screw in a light bulb? A million, if you live in DC. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These things keep cropping up like a plague of locusts or killer bees or boy bands. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someday we will be free to go back to Chinese food or, maybe, on a wild night, Mexican. For now, Thai is king. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the Regent, I love the way this restaurant is decorated. On its slick premises, I took a moment to mourn my dearly departed Grille 88, the Regent's predecessor, done in apparently by a major plumbing accident and, well, a lack of customers. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regent, on the other hand, seems to be constantly alive with patrons and, as best I could tell, is free of leaks, floods and related problems. It is, in fact, quite pleasant inside — warm greens and browns, clunky teak furniture, a tasteful bar, and a delightful wooden house that pleases the latent sissy in me that always wanted a dollhouse. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR THE MOST part, expect what Thai restaurants always have on the menu, but the Regent does turn up the heat on the competition with a few novelties and skillful preparation of the classics. Appetizer-wise, I can tell you I am a kanom jeeb expert, and the Regent's version is among my top three fave picks. These steamed dumplings, stuffed with chicken, shrimp, water chestnuts, garlic, and peppers can, remarkably, be cooked with no flavor at all, but not so here. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chicken satay is nice as well, with rich, creamy curry sauce livening things up. And lest I forget, the Num Tok salad — greens, herbs, onions, and grilled steak in an acidic, sweet dressing (not sweet and sour, I promise) — is refreshing. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A notable exception at the Regent is the Phi Phi Island. This shrimp, scallop and crabmeat platter didn't taste as fresh as one might hope and really wasn't a cohesive concept on the plate. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other options, though, are surprising and really quite good. The lamb is lean, light and flavorful, as is the honey duck. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#666666" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regent's dessert options are limited, although expansion is promised. There were ice creams available but more notable was the mango and sticky rice. Granted, one good batch of mangoes could completely throw off any objective evaluation here, but if there's any kind of consistency about this at the Regent, you're in for a treat. </font></p>

Eighteenth Street's newest Thai restaurant is a lush trip to Bangkok or Pukhet. Rich brownish olive walls are earthy and grounding and stand behind pieces of elaborate Thai artwork, mostly consisting of carved wood. The restaurant, which opened late July, serves up everyone's favorites-summer rolls, satay, curries, fried rice and pad thai-but also cooks up enticing specialties like Phi Phi Island, grilled jumbo shrimp and scallops in chili paste topped with crab meat, and Plaa Pow, a grilled whole rainbow trout stuffed with Thai herbs topped with julienned mango and spicy dipping sauce. <em>On tap </em>predicts that people will <em>love </em>this romantic and escapist getaway amidst bustling Adams Morgan.</font></font><font color="#999999"><br>
