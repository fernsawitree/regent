    <p align="justify"><font color="#333300" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THAI, 
      AND THAI AGAIN: The chunky teak chairs on the patio at 1910 18th St. NW 
      hint at what the new business might be selling, and a whiff of the air inside 
      -- fragrant with curry and sweet herbs -- confirms my hunch: Another Thai 
      restaurant has landed in Washington. This one is called The Regent (202-232-1781) 
      and this one, in a space vacated by 88 in Circle, is uncommonly serene, 
      thanks to a collection of rich wood carvings and walls painted a soothing 
      shade of sage. Owner Chuchart &quot;Bobby&quot; Kampirapang worked as a 
      waiter and cook at the late Chef's Secret in College Park prior to opening 
      this 100-seat restaurant late last month; he hired Saowaluk Wiyagul, a veteran 
      of the kitchens at Busara in Washington and Thai Taste in Manassas to create 
      the menu for the Regent. If the prices are a little higher than what you 
      typically find at the competition, the cooking is several notches more polished. 
      The proof is in the panang (try chicken), sweet with coconut milk and bright 
      with kaffir lime leaves, as well as whole grilled trout stuffed with lime 
      slices and lemongrass. Billed as a house specialty, that fish comes with 
      a dipping sauce of julienne mango and red chilies that brings a sweat on 
      the brow -- and keep you coming back for more. </font></p>

    <p align="justify"><font color="#333300" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE 
      LOUD SIZZLE preceding the arrival of my beef entree, neua krata, seems out 
      of place in the context of the serene Regent Thai Cuisine, where the only 
      other sounds on a slow weeknight have been gentle background music and the 
      tinkle-tinkle of a nearby fountain. The dish sputters like beef fajitas 
      but smells sweetly of Asian spices. A jumble of thin slices of marinated 
      beef, snow peas and other vegetables strewn with sesame seeds, it is one 
      of several signature dishes that set this Thai newcomer apart from the crowd. 
      It's tasty, if a bit more expensive than what you tend to find at your typical 
      issuer of papaya salad and drunken noodles. The Regent takes the place of 
      88 -- and too many other restaurants that have tried to make a go of it 
      on a tricky part of 18th Street NW that seems to belong neither to Adams 
      Morgan nor to Dupont Circle. Launched in July by Chuchart Kampirapang, it 
      gets a boost from Saowaluk Wiyagul in the kitchen and an eye for detail 
      in the dining room. This is apparent early on, with an appetizer of tom 
      yum goong. The shrimp and mushroom soup comes framed in a handsome square-sided 
      bowl, and its assertive flavors -- cilantro, lemon grass, red chilies -- 
      slap my tongue around in a bid for attention. Similarly fetching are spring 
      rolls filled with carrots, cabbage and taro root, cut on the bias and presented 
      as fragile spears with pineapple dipping sauce. There are two high-ceilinged 
      rooms, and both give you a sense of being far away from Washington. A small 
      forest of handsome wood carvings and moss green walls wrap visitors in style 
      and comfort, and the blocky teak chairs and tables underscore the Thai theme. 
      The restaurant bears a resemblance to the nearby Rice in Logan Circle, from 
      the soothing color palette right down to the &quot;Green Corner&quot; emphasizing 
      vegetarian dishes on its bill of fare. Of the signature dishes, the standout 
      is grilled whole trout. The fish is moist, meaty and -- thanks to slices 
      of lemon and lime as well as lemon grass tucked inside -- also fragrant 
      and flavorful. Presented on banana leaf, it's enhanced by a sharp dipping 
      sauce fueled by garlic, lime juice and chilies. Pork-and-seafood dumplings 
      are too compact, and duck is limp and cloying with its honey sauce and dry 
      watercress. Now and then, the kitchen also oversweetens things. But the 
      winners outnumber the lesser choices. Ordering basil fried rice, for instance, 
      brings a glistening mound of fragrant grains stir-fried with the namesake 
      herb, strips of red pepper, a blazing chili sauce and a choice of meat or 
      seafood. Drunken noodles here are thick, slippery and pleasantly smoky ribbons, 
      punched up with a similar sauce and best ordered with tender scored squid. 
      And everything brims with style: Instead of on a plastic check tray, your 
      bill is delivered in a sleek wooden box.</font></p>

      with sometimes decent results. But there is room for improvement.</font></p>

      MANY THAI restaurants does it take to screw in a light bulb? A million, 
      if you live in DC. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#333300" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
      things keep cropping up like a plague of locusts or killer bees or boy bands. 
      </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#333300" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someday 
      we will be free to go back to Chinese food or, maybe, on a wild night, Mexican. 
      For now, Thai is king. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#333300" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
      at the Regent, I love the way this restaurant is decorated. On its slick 
      premises, I took a moment to mourn my dearly departed Grille 88, the Regent's 
      predecessor, done in apparently by a major plumbing accident and, well, 
      a lack of customers. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#333300" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
      Regent, on the other hand, seems to be constantly alive with patrons and, 
      as best I could tell, is free of leaks, floods and related problems. It 
      is, in fact, quite pleasant inside — warm greens and browns, clunky teak 
      furniture, a tasteful bar, and a delightful wooden house that pleases the 
      latent sissy in me that always wanted a dollhouse. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#333300" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR 
      THE MOST part, expect what Thai restaurants always have on the menu, but 
      the Regent does turn up the heat on the competition with a few novelties 
      and skillful preparation of the classics. Appetizer-wise, I can tell you 
      I am a kanom jeeb expert, and the Regent's version is among my top three 
      fave picks. These steamed dumplings, stuffed with chicken, shrimp, water 
      chestnuts, garlic, and peppers can, remarkably, be cooked with no flavor 
      at all, but not so here. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#333300" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
      chicken satay is nice as well, with rich, creamy curry sauce livening things 
      up. And lest I forget, the Num Tok salad — greens, herbs, onions, and grilled 
      steak in an acidic, sweet dressing (not sweet and sour, I promise) — is 
      refreshing. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#333300" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
      notable exception at the Regent is the Phi Phi Island. This shrimp, scallop 
      and crabmeat platter didn't taste as fresh as one might hope and really 
      wasn't a cohesive concept on the plate. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#333300" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other 
      options, though, are surprising and really quite good. The lamb is lean, 
      light and flavorful, as is the honey duck. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#333300" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
      Regent's dessert options are limited, although expansion is promised. There 
      were ice creams available but more notable was the mango and sticky rice. 
      Granted, one good batch of mangoes could completely throw off any objective 
      evaluation here, but if there's any kind of consistency about this at the 
      Regent, you're in for a treat. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#333300" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appetizers 
      range from $5 to $8, entrees from $14 to $20, and desserts are $6. </font></p>

      Good Thai Cooking in Beautiful Surroundings One reason for the popularity<br>
      of Thai cooking is that it is lighter than other Asian cuisines, using<br>
      less oil and less cornstarch for thickening. Many Thai restaurants also<br>
      make compromises to suit what they perceive to be American tastes. These<br>
      often include adjusting the heat level downward because &quot;Americans 
      don't<br>
      like hot food&quot; and adding sugar because &quot;Americans like sweet 
      food.&quot; There<br>
      are, of course, spicier and less spicy dishes in Thai cuisine, and sugar<br>
      plays a part in many dishes, particularly noodle dishes. But adjusting the<br>
      cuisine too much in either direction upsets the balance of sour, sweet,<br>
      hot, and salty that characterizes the nation's cooking. Regent Thai Cuii<br>
      sine, now in the space on 18th Street that once housed Grill 88, is a well<br>
      come addition to DC's galaxy of Thai restaurants. The beautiful dining<br>
      rooms feature a restful fountain, and the walls are hung with Thai woodd<br>
      carvings. Service is knowledgeable and efficient. The food is a bit more<br>
      expensive that at some neighboring Thai establishments, but it is attracc<br>
      tively presented, carefully cooked, and avoids the twin perils of too<br>
      little heat and too much sugar. The chili symbols on the menu provide a<br>
      fairly accurate guide to the heat level of each dish. Thais do not generr<br>
      ally divide meals into courses, but most American Thai restaurants, inn<br>
      cluding Regent Thai, do so in deference to American eating habits. Rewardd<br>
      ing dishes from the appetizer section include dumplings stuffed with pork,<br>
      crab, shrimp, and water chestnuts; nicely fried spring rolls; and tod mun<br>
      goong, shrimp bound in shrimp paste and deep-fried to a lovely crispness<br>
      on the outside. The salad section includes a very good version of greenn<br>
      papaya salad in a spicy chili-and-garlic sauce. Red or green curries with<br>
      chicken, pork, or beef are very well done, but the most interesting choicc<br>
      es are on the list of signature dishes. Pla prow is a wonderfully moist<br>
      grilled rainbow trout stuffed with herbs and served with a julienne of<br>
      mango in a spicy dipping sauce. Duck is stir-fried and served in a chilii<br>
      and-garlic sauce. Pad Thai is not my favorite local version--it's still<br>
      too sweet for me--but drunken noodles, wide rice noodles in a very spicy<br>
      chili-and-garlic sauce, are a hit. Vegetarians will appreciate the large<br>
      number of vegetable offerings. Even at so sophisticated a Thai restaurant,<br>
      the best dessert is still mango and sticky rice. Regent Thai Cuisine 1910<br>

      for lunch, daily for dinner. Atmosphere: Attractive and serene. Food: A<br>
